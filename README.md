# Lyft_Unit_Testing

The repository contains work that has been done for Lyft based off the Forage virtual work experience program. 

The task was as follows:
Using the same repo, you’ve been working on over the course of this program, add unit tests to the codebase. Replace the old test suite in the tests folder with your own series of unit tests. The old test suite should be broken (since you replaced all the classes it tests in the last step) but it should still serve as a handy template to speed you on your way. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the resources on unit testing linked below before you get started. 

Note that you need only test concrete implementations of the engine and battery classes for this task. You may ignore testing on everything else. If you run into problems with the code you wrote in the last task while drafting unit tests, fix it! The goal of testing in this instance is to refine the draft codebase you created in the last task into something that’s guaranteed to work. When you are finished, push your changes, and submit a link to your repo.
